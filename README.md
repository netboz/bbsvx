# BBSvx ü´ß
### *A Blockchain-Powered Distributed VR System That Actually Makes Sense*

## What's a Bubble ? ü§î

BBSvx have nothing related to what we used to know as BBS ( Bulletin Board System ).

The base unit of BBSvx is the onthology ( basically a set of concepts and the relations between them ).

Ontologies are mutable.

Onthologies can be shared or not.

All participants of a shared ontology are forming a blockchain.

An Ontology ( concepts, relations ) can be virtualized as a bounded 3D space. This is called a Bubble.

Changes in ontholgies are triguerred by agents, being themselves ontologies.

Hence Ontologies are interacting with ontologies, as the support of a virtualed 3D space.

This is BBSvx

## The "Distributed Bottle Emptying" Problem üç∫

Imagine an agent trying to empty a bottle. In traditional systems, there's usually only one rigid path to achieve this goal. But BBSvx's ontology system let you provides multiple action pathways:

```prolog
action(drink_bottle(Bottle), [cap_opened(Bottle)], empty(Bottle)).
action(wait(hour(1)), [cap_opened(Bottle), upside_down(Bottle)], empty(Bottle)).
```

Here we see two different ways to achieve the same goal (`empty(Bottle)`): either by drinking it (requiring an opened cap) or by waiting an hour with the bottle upside down and cap opened. The agent will:

1. Check if the goal `empty(Bottle)` is already achieved
2. If not, attempt to satisfy prerequisites like `cap_opened(Bottle)`
3. Execute the transition to reach the final state

This demonstrates how BBSvx's distributed ontologies enable flexible, intelligent problem-solving across the network. Knowledge about different action strategies bubbles up naturally and spreads through the SPRAY protocol, creating a shared understanding of multiple solution paths.

*This is the real power of BubbleSoap Systems: structured knowledge that flows naturally through distributed networks, enabling emergent intelligence.*



## Architecture: The BubbleSoap Factory üèóÔ∏è

BBSvx operates like a sophisticated bubble-making apparatus where each node generates and manages knowledge bubbles that interact with bubbles from other nodes. This creates a dynamic, self-organizing system powered by:

- **[SPRAY Protocol](https://hal.science/hal-01203363)**: Like air currents that carry bubbles, managing how nodes discover and interact with each other
- **[EPTO Protocol](https://www.dpss.inesc-id.pt/~mm/papers/2015/middleware_epto.pdf)**: Ensuring bubbles merge and split in a consistent order across the network
- **Leader Election**: Because even in bubble dynamics, surface tension needs coordination
- **Prolog Integration**: Using [Erlog](https://github.com/rvirding/erlog) to give our bubbles structured knowledge and reasoning capabilities

---

## Current Status üìä

**Alpha Release** - Like a bubble mixture that's just reached the perfect consistency:

- ‚úÖ **SPRAY Network**: Bubbles are forming and spreading beautifully
- ‚úÖ **EPTO Messaging**: Bubble interactions are consistently ordered
- ‚úÖ **Leader Election**: Surface tension dynamics working perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Blockchain Integration**: Knowledge bubbles are cryptographically secured
- ‚úÖ **Smart Configuration**: No more command-line argument complexity
- üöß **Documentation**: You're reading the improved bubble manual right now!

## Configuration Made Simple üõ†Ô∏è

Gone are the days of wrestling with complex command-line arguments. BBSvx now features intelligent configuration management that adapts like soap film to changing conditions.

### User-Friendly Config Files üìù

BBSvx automatically searches for config files in user-friendly locations:

1. **Environment variable**: `BBSVX_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/config`
2. **User space**: `~/.bbsvx/bbsvx.conf` (recommended for development)
3. **Current directory**: `./bbsvx.conf`
4. **Release default**: `etc/bbsvx.conf` (production)

**Create your personal config with one command:**
```bash
# Initialize user config in ~/.bbsvx/bbsvx.conf
./bin/bbsvx config init

# Or specify a custom location
./bin/bbsvx config init --path ./my-bbsvx.conf

# Check where your config file is located
./bin/bbsvx config locate

# View current configuration
./bin/bbsvx show

# Set configuration values
./bin/bbsvx set boot=root
./bin/bbsvx set network.p2p_port=3000
```

**Quick config editing examples:**
```bash
# First time? Create the initial bubble (in your home directory)
echo "boot = root" >> ~/.bbsvx/bbsvx.conf
./bin/bbsvx start

# Joining an existing bubble cluster? Easy as soap
echo "boot = join existing.node.com 2304" >> ~/.bbsvx/bbsvx.conf  
./bin/bbsvx start

# Restarting? We're smart enough to detect existing bubble patterns
echo "boot = auto" >> ~/.bbsvx/bbsvx.conf
./bin/bbsvx start

# Using current directory config
echo "boot = root" >> ./bbsvx.conf
./bin/bbsvx start
```

**Environment variables work like bubble wands:**
```bash
# Override config file location
BBSVX_CONFIG_FILE=./my-config.conf ./bin/bbsvx start

# Quick parameter overrides
BBSVX_BOOT="root" ./bin/bbsvx start
BBSVX_P2P_PORT=3000 BBSVX_HTTP_PORT=9000 ./bin/bbsvx start
```

## The BubbleSoap Philosophy ü´ß

BBSvx embodies the BubbleSoap philosophy: knowledge should flow naturally and beautifully through distributed systems, just like soap bubbles floating on air currents. Each bubble carries structured information, and when bubbles meet, they can merge their knowledge or split to explore new territories.

Unlike rigid systems that force information through predefined channels, BBSvx lets knowledge bubble up organically, creating emergent patterns of understanding that are both resilient and aesthetically pleasing to observe.

---

## Ontologies üß†

Ontologies in BBSvx are knowledge repositories that help agents perform tasks within specific domains. They serve as the foundation for distributed reasoning and action coordination across the network.

### Namespace Structure

Ontologies follow a hierarchical namespace format:
```
bbsvx:subdomain1:subdomain2:...:subdomain_N
```

**Example namespaces:**
- `"bbsvx:agent"` - System ontology for agent management
- `"bbsvx:mts:client:mqtt"` - Message transport ontologies
- `"bbsvx:workflow:automation"` - Workflow management ontologies
- `"bbsvx:security:auth"` - Authentication and security ontologies

Each namespace creates an isolated knowledge domain that can be independently managed, versioned, and distributed across the network.

### Ontology Types

- **Shared Ontologies**: Distributed across the network, synchronized through SPRAY and EPTO protocols
- **Local Ontologies**: Node-specific knowledge that remains private
- **System Ontologies**: Core BBSvx functionality (like `bbsvx:root`)

---

## Actions üéØ

Actions in BBSvx follow a structured Prolog-based design pattern that enables flexible goal achievement and intelligent planning.

### Action Predicate Structure

Every action follows this pattern:
```prolog
action(Transition, [Prerequisites], FinalState).
```

**Components:**
- **Transition**: The action to be performed
- **Prerequisites**: List of conditions that must be satisfied before execution
- **FinalState**: The desired outcome after action completion

### Practical Example: Bottle Emptying Strategies

```prolog
% Direct approach - drink the bottle
action(drink_bottle(Bottle), [cap_opened(Bottle)], empty(Bottle)).

% Patient approach - wait for gravity
action(wait(hour(1)), [cap_opened(Bottle), upside_down(Bottle)], empty(Bottle)).

% Prerequisite actions
action(open_cap(Bottle), [has_bottle_opener], cap_opened(Bottle)).
action(turn_upside_down(Bottle), [], upside_down(Bottle)).
```

### Goal Resolution Process

When an agent receives a goal like `empty(bottle_1)`, the system:

1. **Goal Check**: Verify if `empty(bottle_1)` is already achieved
2. **Action Discovery**: Find all actions that result in `empty(Bottle)`
3. **Prerequisite Resolution**: Recursively satisfy prerequisites for chosen actions
4. **Execution**: Perform the transition and update the knowledge base
5. **Propagation**: Share the outcome across the distributed network

This approach enables emergent problem-solving where agents can discover multiple solution paths and share successful strategies across the bubble network.

## Final Words üçª

BBSvx represents the evolution of distributed knowledge systems from rigid hierarchies to organic, bubble-like formations. It's like upgrading from industrial plumbing to a beautiful soap bubble display ‚Äì same information flow, but now with natural beauty and emergent complexity.

Whether you're building distributed knowledge systems, experimenting with blockchain technology, or just fascinated by the parallels between soap bubble physics and distributed computing, BBSvx offers a unique perspective on how information can flow naturally through networks.

*Remember: In the BubbleSoap System, every node is both a bubble maker and a bubble observer. The beauty emerges from the interactions, not from central control.*
